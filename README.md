Work in progress.

## Step 1: Lexicon Generation
### Preliminary phonology consonant classification
The preliminary phonology is roughly based on English consonants and Wolof short vowels.
This is in order to create a baseline for orthographic variability.
It is designed such that different rankings or phonemic inventories can be used later.
* 0: voiceless obstruent
* 1: voiced obstruent
* 2: sonorant
* 3: semivowel
